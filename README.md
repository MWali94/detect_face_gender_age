# detect_face_gender_age

Developed a Python script in Google Colab to capture photos via webcam and predict age and gender using pre-trained deep learning models. Integrated Google Drive for model storage and utilized OpenCV for image processing.
<ul>
  <li>Technologies: Python, OpenCV, JavaScript snippet, Matplotlib, Google Colab, Google Drive.</li>
  <li>Integrated webcam functionality to capture images within a Google Colab environment using JavaScript.</li>
  <li>Mounted Google Drive to access and load pre-trained models for face detection, age, and gender prediction.</li>
  <li>Employed OpenCV's deep learning module (dnn) to process images and make predictions. Annotated detected faces with predicted age and gender and displayed the results using 
      Matplotlib.</li>
  <li>function detect_face_gender_age is set up to detect faces, predict age, and gender from a given image.</li>
